            <p class="about__text-1 about-content">An avid cyclist and honours graduate of Central St. Martins, Quoc was
                founded in 2009 by namesake and founder, Quoc
                Pham, after he found that traditional performance cycling shoes were not best suited to the to and fro
                nature of city
                cycling. Quoc's goal was simple: to design a cycling shoe that combined comfort, elegance and style for
                the daily ride.</p>

                    The first Quoc urban cycling shoes combined the performance and functionality of the best
                    contemporary bicycle footwear
                    with the style of a casual dress shoe. Notable models included the original Fixed silhouette and the
                    Tourer, both of
                    which became bywords for quality, craftsmanship and performance, helping to establish an urban
                    cycling movement that
                    valued a seamless and stylish transition from pedal to pavement.

                    Over the years our range has expanded to meet the demands of different cyclists, extending to road
                    cycling shoes and
                    gravel bike shoes, but the Quoc ethos remains the same: to create beautifully made, stylish cycling
                    footwear for both on
                    and off the bike.
